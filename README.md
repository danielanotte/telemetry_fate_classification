# telemetry_fate_classification

Example code that was used to analyze data from acoustic predation tags and develop a standardized workflow for identifying predated individuals using machine learning approaches. Code was originally used to identify predation of tagged Atlantic salmon smolts by striped bass in the Stewiacke Watershed, Nova Scotia. Manuscript entitled "Application of machine learning and acoustic predation tags to classify migration fate of Atlantic salmon smolts" which details workflow development is in review.
